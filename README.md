# TextReplacer

#### Local Setup

Please run following command to install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Assumptions Made

- Case-insensitive replacement is preferred by default
- All occurrences of a search term should be replaced globally
- Users want to be able to reset the entire form easily
- Basic error handling (like alerting when no search term is provided) is necessary
- The text replacement should work with any text input, including paragraphs, code, etc.
